      <h3><b>Top 10 Batsmen</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Top 10 Batsman.png"  width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Virat Kohli has scored the most runs in this tournament so far. Four out of five top run-getters are Indians. This shows the dominance of Indian players in this league. Suresh Raina remains in the #2 spot despite missing the 13th edition of IPL. MS Dhoni, and AB de Villers are the only two middle-order batsmen who made it to the top 10 run getters.</b></p><br>

      <h3><b>Top 10 Bowlers</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Top 10 Bowlers.png" width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Lasith Malinga has taken the most number of wickets in the tournament so far. Four out of the top six wicket-takers are Indian spinners. This shows the importance of Indian spinners during the middle overs. Malinga, Bravo, and Narine are the only foreigners in this list.  </b></p><br>

      <img src="IPL/Runs and Wickets - Overwise Analysis.png" width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        It can be seen that most of the runs-scored and wickets-taken are during the last three overs of a game. This is because the batsmen are ready to take the risk of losing their wicket and look to slog the balls. There is a dip in the number of runs-scored and wickets-taken after the power-play. This shows that the batsman tries to make the most out of the field restriction during the final over of the powerplay.</b></p><br>

      <h3><b>Number of Player From Each Country</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Number of Player From Each Country.png"  width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        Out of 310 players who have played at least one IPL match so far, more than half of them are Indians. The rule of playing the utmost four-foreign players is one of the primary reasons for this. About 70 Australian cricketers have taken part in this league so far. This is the most for any country, followed by South Africa.

      <h3><b>Player of the Match</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Player of the Match.png"  width="450" height="400">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        AB de Villers has won the most number of 'player of the match' awards so far. The larger the size of the circle, the higher the number of times the player has won. The color of the circle shows the team the player lastly played for.

      <h3><b>Percentage of Wins</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Percentage of Wins.png"  width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        The probability of winning a match by chasing is 8.74% more than the probability of winning by defending. Being a batsman dominated tournament, the batsman can strategize their gameplan when they know their target. However, there is a factor of pressure while chasing which the batsman needs to overcome.

      <h3><b>Toss</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Toss.png" width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        Mumbai Indians has won the most number of tosses so far, followed by Kolkata Knight Riders. Mumbai Indians has chosen to defend on 58 occasions. This can be because of the nature of their home ground. Wankhede stadium is known for chasing and teams struggle to defend a score with the dew factor coming in during the evening matches.

      <h3><b>Most matches hosted</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Most matches hosted.png"   width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        Eden Gardens, a famous stadium which is the home for 'Kolkata Knight Riders' has hosted the most number of matches so far. In most of the grounds, the winning team prefers to chase. This has been the trend for the past few years as the teams are now confident about chasing any big target thanks to the muscular batsmen and bigger bats. Only in Chepauk Stadium(Chennai), the toss winner prefers batting first. This is because the pitch in Chennai tends to get slower and becomes difficult for the batsmen to read the spinners.

      <h3><b>Most Catches</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Most Catches.png"   width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        Four out of the top five in this list are wicketkeepers. This is self-explanatory because the ball has some swing during the first few overs of an innings and the wicketkeepers are getting some purchase when the batsman nicks the ball. MS Dhoni has taken the most number of catches and has played the most number of matches in the history of IPL.

      <h3><b>Runs and Wickets - Ballwise Analysis</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Runs and Wickets - Ballwise Analysis.png"   width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        The above plot shows the ball-wise analysis in an over. The number of runs scored in the first ball of an over is fewer when compared with the other balls. This is because the batsman tries to gauge the bowler's line and length, and plan accordingly to play the remaining balls of the over. The distribution of wickets have been quite uniform and we cannot make any conclusions here.

      <h3><b>Economy Rates</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Economy Rates.png"   width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        The average runs scored in the first over of an innings is only 5.73. During the first few overs, the seamers try to swing the ball, and thus the batsman play tentatively. The run-rate goes up to 8 runs per over on average during the other overs of powerplay. The run-rate comes down and steadily increases after the field restrictions get lifted. The batsman tends to play aggressively during the last few overs, and the run-rate goes up to 10.5 runs on average.

      <h3><b>Highest Strike Rate</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Highest Strike Rate.png"   width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        The strike rate is a measure of the speed at which a batsman is scoring. It tells how much runs a player will score if he/she faces 100 balls. One interesting observation is that all the top three players are West Indians. This shows the batting style of West Indian players. The players who get featured here should score at least 500 IPL runs.

      <h3><b>Dismissal Kind</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Dismissal Kind.png"   width="750" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        Out of 9,495 dismissals, 5743 are catches, and 1700 are by getting bowled. This shows the nature of the tournament. Batsmen are taking the risk of getting out and play aggressively.

      <img src="IPL/Runs scored in each city.png"  alt="Runs and Wickets - Overwise Analysis" width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        The grounds in Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and Delhi are high scoring ones. Thus the teams should play aggressive players on such grounds because the scoring is easier on such grounds.
            </b></p><br>

      <h3><b>Wickets taken in each city</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Wickets taken in each city.png"  alt="Runs and Wickets - Overwise Analysis" width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        The most number of wickets (1,235) is taken in Mumbai. Despite hosting the most number of matches, only 878 wickets are taken in Kolkata. However, the number of wickets taken in a venue depends on the number of matches played in that particular venue.

      <h3><b>Best Economy Rates</b></h3>
      <img src="IPL/Best Economy Rates.png"  alt="Runs and Wickets - Overwise Analysis" width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        Rashid Khan is the most economical bowler in the tournament with an economy-rate of 6.33. Five out of top six most economical bowlers are spinners. This maybe because spinners bowl in the middle overs where the average economy-rate is around 7.5. The darker the color, the more wickets the bowler has taken. The bowler should have bowled atleast 100 overs to feature in this list. We can infer that spinners are economical and end up taking lesser wickets when compared with the fast bowlers.

      <img src="IPL/Most Wins by Each Team.png"  alt="Runs and Wickets - Overwise Analysis" width="900" height="450">
      <p class="w3-large"><b>
        Mumbai Indians has won the most number of games so far (120), followed by Chennai Super Kings with 106 wins. With 5 IPL trophies and 2 Champions League trophies, we can conclude that Mumbai Indians is the best IPL team so far.
